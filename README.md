# Spring Boot REST API for Matches, Performances, Players, and Teams

This project is a REST API built using Spring Boot. It manages four main entities: `matches`, `performances`, `players`, and `teams`. The API supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each entity.

## Features
- CRUD operations for all entities:
  - **Matches**
  - **Performances**
  - **Players**
  - **Teams**
- Layered architecture:
  - **Controller**: Defines the routes.
  - **Service**: Contains the business logic.
- Integrated with Postman for API testing (screenshot included).
